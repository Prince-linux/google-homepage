# google-homepage
This is a mini-project, a google like search homepage. 
The links don’t go anywhere and the search box doesn’t do anything when you submit it. 
The goal is to start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned.

These skills were helpful when I started building:

Two ways to move a div around on the page
Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
Identify the background color of an existing webpage
Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
Center an element horizontally
Identify three ways to include your CSS styles in a page
Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
Build a very basic form (even if it doesn’t “go” anywhere)
